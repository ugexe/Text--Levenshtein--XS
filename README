NAME
    Text::Levenshtein::XS - Calculate edit distance based on insertion,
    deletion, substitution, and transposition

VERSION
    version 0.428

SYNOPSIS
        use Text::Levenshtein::XS qw/distance/;

        print distance('Neil','Niel');
        # prints 2

DESCRIPTION
    Returns the number of edits (insert,delete,substitute) required to turn
    the source string into the target string. XS implementation (requires a
    C compiler). Works correctly with utf8.

        use Text::Levenshtein::XS qw/distance/;
        use utf8;

        distance('ⓕⓞⓤⓡ','ⓕⓤⓞⓡ'), 
        # prints 2

METHODS
  distance
    Arguments: $source_text, $target_text, (optional) $max_distance
    Return Value: Int $edit_distance || undef (if max_distance is exceeded)

    Returns: int that represents the edit distance between the two argument,
    or undef if $max_distance threshold is exceeded.

    Takes the edit distance between a source and target string using XS 2
    vector implementation.

        use Text::Levenshtein::XS qw/distance/;
        print distance('Neil','Niel');
        # prints 2

    Stops calculations and returns undef if $max_distance is set, non-zero
    (0 = no limit), and the algorithm has determined the final distance will
    be greater than $max_distance.

        my $distance = distance('Neil','Niel',1);
        print (defined $distance) ? $distance : "Exceeded max distance";
        # prints "Exceeded max distance"

NOTES
    Drop in replacement for Text::LevenshteinXS
